# roadmap-sync-2026-02-04

- Why: align implementation progress with roadmap phases before packaging decisions.

## Files Changed

- `.planning/ROADMAP.md`
- `docs/commits/roadmap-sync-2026-02-04.md`

## Summary

- Added concrete completed/pending plan items for Phase 1 and Phase 2.
- Updated progress table to mark both phases as `In progress`.
- Identified remaining phase-critical work (manual QA closure, real waveform/rhythm extraction, scale testing).

## Risk Notes

- If roadmap status is not kept current per sprint, release readiness can be misjudged.
