# phase2-stress-100k-2026-02-04

- Why: continue roadmap scale validation with a higher pair cap and record findings.

## Files Changed

- `docs/qa/PHASE2_STRESS_2026-02-04.md`
- `docs/PHASE2_STRESS_TEST.md`

## Summary

- Added 100k stress-run results with timings and memory snapshots.
- Documented cache carry-over behavior from prior run.
- Added guidance to use fresh DB paths for clean cold benchmarks.

## Validation

- Stress command completed:
  - `npm run stress:phase2 -- --xml /home/thomas/rekordbox_backup.xml --max-pairs 100000`

## Risk Notes

- Long-running cold analysis remains the primary bottleneck before Phase 2 can be considered complete.
