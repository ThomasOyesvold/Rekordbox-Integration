# b0a5606 - Add table virtualization, analysis export, and Electron smoke harness

- Date: 2026-02-04
- Why: Improve performance for larger track sets and add result export + smoke verification path.

## Files Changed

- `README.md`
- `docs/PROJECT_GUIDE.md`
- `electron/main.js`
- `electron/preload.cjs`
- `electron/preload.js`
- `package.json`
- `renderer/App.jsx`
- `src/services/analysisExportService.js`
- `test/analysisExportService.test.js`
- `test/electronSmoke.test.js`

## Summary

- Added virtualized rendering in track table viewport.
- Added baseline analysis export as CSV/JSON.
- Added Electron smoke harness and test scaffold.

## Validation

- `npm test` passed.
- `npm run build:renderer` passed.
- Smoke command may fail in restricted sandbox due to Electron runtime constraints.

## Risk Notes

- Virtualization relies on fixed row-height assumptions.
- Smoke test reliability varies by environment/sandbox policy.
