# b878452 - Improve track table UX with persistent columns, density, and pagination

- Date: 2026-02-04
- Why: Improve large-library usability and allow personalized table layout.

## Files Changed

- `electron/main.js`
- `electron/preload.cjs`
- `renderer/App.jsx`
- `renderer/styles.css`

## Summary

- Added column visibility toggles.
- Added table density modes (`cozy`/`compact`).
- Added pagination controls and page size.
- Persisted table preferences in saved app state.

## Validation

- `npm test` passed at time of commit.
- Renderer build passed at time of commit.

## Risk Notes

- UI state persistence now includes more fields; state migration depends on safe defaults.
