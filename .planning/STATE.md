## Snapshot
- Desktop shell working (Electron + React).
- XML parse + validation + folder filtering working.
- Track table supports filter, sort, selection, and details.
- Track table supports keyboard shortcuts and fast focus workflow.
- SQLite supports import history + analysis runs + similarity cache.
- Baseline scoring pipeline is in place (BPM/key + ANLZ waveform/rhythm signatures).
- Rhythm scoring now includes kick-pattern signature when ANLZ data is available.
- Baseline result rows now include plain-language component reasoning.
- Validation panel supports severity filtering (all/error/warning).
- **Audio playback working in WSL with comprehensive debugging**.
- Playback stabilized with single shared audio element + UI update throttle.
- Similar track cards support seekable waveform previews and playhead needle.
- Quick Preview shows Now Playing strip (timer + BPM/key) and volume control.
- Nested TRACK metadata (TEMPO/POSITION_MARK) is parsed and now visible with summaries.

## Top Next Tasks
1. Phase 3: tune preset thresholds (raise exploratory pair cap or threshold) if clusters are too sparse
2. Run long-run stress tests for 12K+ libraries (Phase 2 safeguards validation)
3. Parse specific nested TRACK metadata blocks (e.g., hot cues/loops) if present in newer exports
4. UI redesign Phase 05-05 final polish + QA pass for Track Details + Quick Preview
5. Add folder-level analysis summary cards (selected folder mix profile)
6. Add integration test around keyboard shortcuts and severity filters
7. Surface nested-metadata warnings with actionable remediation text in UI

## Known Risks
- Real-world Rekordbox XML variability still under-covered by fixtures.
- Large library performance (12K+ tracks) needs stress testing before Phase 3
- Audio playback in Windows production may need custom protocol handler (rbfa://)
- If `vite build` fails with EACCES in `node_modules/.vite-temp`, reinstall deps without sudo.

## Production Readiness Tracking

- [ ] Phase 3 complete (playlist generation)
- [ ] Phase 4 complete (verification workflow) - Audio playback: DONE ✅
